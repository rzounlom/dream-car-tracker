      "The 2022 Chiron isn't only the ultimate Bugatti, it's the ultimate car. Period. This $3 million work of art is capable of pummeling the pavement at over 200 mph thanks to a 16-cylinder engine that features four turbochargers and cranks out at least 1500 horsepower—the more expensive Super Sport model is even more powerful. The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor drawbacks",

      "Overview Lamborghini is a brand known for its extroverted styling and brash performance, which is embodied perfectly by the V-10–powered Huracán supercar. With 600-plus horsepower roaring just behind the cabin, the Huracán delivers heart-pounding acceleration with a spine-tingling soundtrack to match. It's just as home on the road as it is on a race track, and in both situations it delivers the razor-sharp handling you'd expect of a six-figure sports car. To turn up the insanity even further, a rally-inspired Huracán Sterrato with a raised suspension, a roof-top snorkel air intake, and special all-terrain tires is ready to do some light off-roading—and in our experience it's hilariously fun. The same can be said of the rest of the Huracán lineup, too, and its boisterous personality and extroverted looks imbue it with a charming outrageousness that rivals from Ferrari and McLaren can't quite match.",
